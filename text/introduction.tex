\section{Introduction}

This text represents an overview of preliminary work for a project concerning display networks.
It will be done for the Human Computer Interaction Project at the University of Ulm.

\subsection{Overview}

System types describes the possible permutations of connecting devices, systems, and users with each other.
Related work shortly presents papers and or articles that could be relevant or might be of help.
The section on general interaction aspects discusses input and output modalities.
Next we discuss network aspects and what different aspects could be used for a display network.
Finally we noted our initial suggestions for a project that could be done within the confines of the project circumstances.

\subsection{Data to Go}

One part of the proposed architecture would be location aware data sharing within the display network.
This is envisioned to work in two general modes, which are based on the underlying location sharing described in section \ref{location_sharing}.

Due to the high number of personal devices that are in use in the target environment, a client program will be required for easy access to data that a user wants to share.
